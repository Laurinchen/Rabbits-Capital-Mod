Welcome to Kaninchens Capital mod.
In this Mod, every players owns their own capital, the capital must be protected at all cost.
It should also be a priority to capture other capitals.
Note that you cannot attack a teammates capital or gift your own capital away.
You can look at all capitals you own in the Mod Menu.

Note that due to technical limitations your first capital bonus will be deployed on your capital. On all other turns you can deploy it freely!
